This test verifies that scrolling a very short distance via pan gesture on iOS does
        not dispatch a click event. To manually test, perform a quick, short-distance pan on each of
        the green boxes below.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS overflowScrolled became true
