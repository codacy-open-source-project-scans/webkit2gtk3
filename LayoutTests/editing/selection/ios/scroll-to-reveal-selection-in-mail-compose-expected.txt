This test verifies that tapping near the bottom of an editable web view configured similarly to Mail compose causes us to scroll to reveal the selection. To manually run the test on iOS, compose a new Mail message that contains enough content to require scrolling, and tap near the bottom of the message.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
