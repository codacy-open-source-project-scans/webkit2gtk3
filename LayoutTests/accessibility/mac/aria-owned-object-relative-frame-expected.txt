This test ensures we compute the relative frame of aria-owned objects correctly.


{ AXRole: AXGroup #body } has AXRelativeFrame: NSRect: {{8, 8}, {784, 584}}

{ AXRole: AXTable #table } has AXRelativeFrame: NSRect: {{8, 8}, {784, 192}}

{ AXRole: AXRow #row1 } has AXRelativeFrame: NSRect: {{58, 94}, {633, 106}}

{ AXRole: AXCell #row1-cell1 } has AXRelativeFrame: NSRect: {{8, 8}, {784, 18}}

{ AXRole: AXCell #row1-cell2 } has AXRelativeFrame: NSRect: {{8, 26}, {784, 18}}
