This test verifies that discrete wheel events trigger scroll snapping in overflow areas, even if layout occurs during scrolling. To manually run the test, scroll using a physical mouse wheel and verify that a single scroll tick animates to the next snap point, such that only the green box is visible.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
