This test verifies that tapping immediately after swiping to the next snap point
        doesn't cause us to snap backwards to the previous snap point when a top obscured inset is
        specified. This test requires WebKitTestRunner, though you can also load the page in iOS
        Safari to test (or any app that sets obscured insets).

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS Snapped to second container
